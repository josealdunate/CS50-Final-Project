# RE.Nection

Have you ever wondered how many deals are you losing for not keeping track of your clients' needs? 

As a Realtor, you will meet at least 20 potential buyers for every property you list. Only one of them will probably buy it, but, what about the remaining 19? In a few weeks of listing new propertys and meeting new potential buyers, you will forget about their requests, reducing your chances to make more deals.

RE.NECTION is the solution for this problem !

It will constantly be comparing your clients needs to your listing's features, reminding you who would be interesed on a specific property.
